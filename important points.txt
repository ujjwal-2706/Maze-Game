1. Always while using SDL library, remember to initially initialize to NULL
2. Don't forget to deallocate all surfaces and widows
3. SDL_Window is like the pixel(final display) we want to display and SDL_Render is like the 
    the settings of that window which will change
4. Think of rendercopy means applying the thing on top of the previous thing like a canvas
5. In order to move the player think of using the destination rectangle in the updation(SDL_Rect)
6. In order to get the time use SDL_GetTicks() [Not the absolute one]
7. For 1 window exactly 1 renderer will be used
8. All we have to do is use the rendercopy function in the order of layers you want to display
then just move or change the textures accordingly and with that we will be able to make a moving
and user controlled game
